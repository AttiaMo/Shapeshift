    ----------

    be opened either in Xcode or Swift Playgrounds on the iPad.

    Usage: shapeshift [playgroundName]

    You can also pass the -icloud flag to have Shapeshift move
    the generated playground to your iCloud Drive, to make it easy
    to open it in Swift Playgrounds on the iPad.
